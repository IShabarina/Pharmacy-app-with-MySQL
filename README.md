# Pharmacy-app-with-MySQL
Website of pharmacy with MySQL base.

This project is implemented as a diploma thesis for my younger brother :)
It's an online pharmacy store with data storage and the ability to modify information (products by categories, clients, users) in a MySQL database.

The website was hosted on hostland.ru (using a Node.js server implementation) with the database managed through phpMyAdmin.
